I am looking for someone who can create a series of graphics/cartoons/drawings and potentially some animations, for an online education course. 

The course has 5 modules and each module has a few dozen images, diagrams or pictures, which we'd like to be redone to all be in the same style and branding, perhaps using a character that can be repeated throughout the course. In addition, it would be great if we could have some gif of that character for reactions to the students' answers. 

Happy to have a quick call with the artist to explain in more detail if that helps. 

I can provide access to the course and highlight which of the pictures/diagrams we would like to be redrawn. There are probably around 200 in total but I can confirm the exact number in the next few days.

We would ideally need these all to be completed by February 5th, but we could also do them in batches i.e. the first 2 modules by Feb 5th and then subsequent modules each delivered every 3-4 weeks. 

Please specify in your proposal which deadline(s) you would be able to meet (i.e. all by 5th Feb or module by module). 

I'm including a few examples below of the images. 

Many thanks

Human Helix,Design,Expert ($$$),3D Design,GBP,500.0,remote,ALL,fixed_price,2023-01-24 12:50:57,"HI

I need a high quality finished result so please apply if you feel you have a strong understanding of figurative 3D skills and the ability to work well to this brief.

What we need:
A 3D sculpture, In the shape of double helix made out of people. They should be a mix of genders and ages. Almost like a a baroque painting, cherubs and nudes. 

An important factor is that the figures need to represent African descendants. So, some with dreadlocks etc

We do not need the faces too detailed so I would love it if you can make the general form quite angular and flat so we haven't got the issue of detail making the file too large - so, a flatter, chiseled finish please.

Please make the file available for blender and 3D printable too. The maquette/model will be about 40cm tall but we may need to enlarge it in the future so please give me access to different sized files too. 

We have 3 weeks before I need this job done and i will need updates as we go.

I will attach different images to show you the type of shape of a DNA Helix - please note, the groove element that will be explained in the file - this is how the curves go in an A, B, A pattern of one large one small - look it up if u need, there are many videos on youtube. Or ask and ill send you some.

I will also attach ideas of how the figures will hold each other too.

One image is AI generated and of the figures holding hands - I like everything about this apart from how they are holding each other- I need them to be hand to foot or hand to hand, maybe to convey the bit in the middle of the DNA strand you can have a person go across it too.
Also i do not want to see a seperate helix - just the one made from the people.

I have a more simple example of how this project was done at earlier stage with just hands that i will send to you after as its a large file.

This will be an ongoing project so plenty of scope to work together more if you can smash this one for me.

The software should fully support Arabic and English language. The software provider should make certain that all modern security details have been taken into account such as email verification OTP etc. The modified vehicle r software follows the following customer journey:

CSS selectors to program a web scraper,Technology & Programming,Entry ($),Programming & Coding,GBP,200.0,remote,ALL,fixed_price,2023-01-23 21:03:53,"We're looking for a developer with good knowledge of CSS selectors. Your job will be to write the CSS selectors to program a web scraper to gather data from online retailers. You can verify the selector works by running document.querySelector(SELECTOR) or document.querySelectorAll(SELECTOR) in the dev tools console. 

1. pageNumberParameter - Paste the URL parameter that determines which page of results to show, e.g. from this link ""https://www.very.co.uk/sports-leisure/mens-sports-clothing/outdoor/e/b/119443,2781.end?pageNumber=2"" you would find ?pageNumber=2 and replace the page number with $i so it becomes ?pageNumber=$i
2. acceptCookiesSelector - This one is only required if the site has a cookies popup that blocks the page. Paste the CSS selector for a button that accepts the cookies.
3. pageCountSelector - CSS selector for the button or other HTML element where the innerText is ONLY the last page number. E.g. if there are 30 pages of jeans, find an element whose only text is ""30"" - this is typically located with several page buttons that might look like 1 2 3 4 5 ... 30
4. searchPageGrid - CSS selector on the search page for the container that holds all the links to product pages.
5. searchPageOrigin - CSS selector for the a tags with hrefs linking to product pages, duplicate hrefs don't matter but try to skip any ads. Instead of running document.querySelectorAll, this will be run like searchPageGrid.querySelectorAll so sometimes this can be simple as ""a""
6. searchPageTitle - CSS selector for the product title on the search page
7. searchPagePrice - CSS selector for the CURRENT product price on the search page
8. searchPageThumbnail - CSS selector for the product thumbnail on the search page, must have a src or a data-src or a data-srcset attribute with a link to the image. Make sure it works on all the products on the page because sometimes they're lazy-loaded.
9. productTitle - CSS selector for the product title on the product page
10. price - CSS selector for the product price on the product page
11. oldPrice - CSS selector for the original product price on the product page (if it doesn't exist, leave blank, but make sure to check at least one discounted product)
12. image - CSS selector for the first product image on the product page, must have a src or a data-src or a data-srcset attribute with a link to the image
We will be running the scraper and checking that each site is scraped correctly. You will be paid for each retailer you complete so make sure there are no errors. It should take about 10 minutes per retailer. If you're unsure how to write the selectors on a site/field, move onto the next one and fill in the text box(es) with the word TODO and we'll complete those ones. Start your proposal with ""CSS Selector"" so we know you've read it all. 

We're looking for someone who can scrape 75 of these sites this week. If you do a good job on this, there may be ongoing work for you as we add more retailers.

Create  ‘Bespoke’ Chain for Handbag Straps,Design,Expert ($$$),Fashion & Clothing,GBP,250.0,remote,ALL,fixed_price,2023-01-23 20:12:21,"TODAY’S BRIEF …To Get Proposed Business Launched
To source,… 
T-bars 2. Chain (with unique design) and 3. Jump rings that have all already been designed and are available to buy to create a series of 16cm long pieces of chain that will have a T-bar at one end and a jump ring at the other end.

Just Like this Skull Bracelet But with Openable-Closable Jump Ring
One of the attachments shown below shows a skull bracelet that looks very much like the kind of 16cm long piece I would to have created - please note the T-bar at one end and jump ring at the other. The 16cm chain lengths will be employ to create chain-leather-chain handbag straps like the one shown in one of the attachments below. Without the need for cutting/welding, a handbag factory will attach the chains to leather straps by prying the jump rings open, threading the jump rings through eyelets on the leather straps and then closing the jump rings closed - that why the jump rings at the end of each 16cm long chain length has to be openable-closable. 

Material
Ideally, I would like these creation to look like shiny silver but be created from the kind of material usually employ to create handbag ‘hardware’. Oftentimes this is zinc alloy or brass, I think.


A Set of 4 Identical 16cm Long Unique Chain Pieces  (Times At Least 4)
For the first such unique chain that is sourced I would like four identical of such 16cm long pieces created. Then I would like to repeat that at least three more times - with three different unique chain designs. (So in total, I will end up with at least 16 pieces of the 16cm long creations.

Can You Source/Suggest Candidate Chain Design?
I would love one of the set of four 16cm chain length to created from a skull design just like the shown skull bracelet. Can you source such a chain? I would love if you could source similar chains that are made of identifiable items i .e chain made of interconnected , say, dogs, flowers, cats, other animals etc. And/or can you source chain designs that you think will help create beautiful handbags?

CSS selectors to program a web scraper,Technology & Programming,Entry ($),Programming & Coding,GBP,200.0,remote,ALL,fixed_price,2023-01-23 21:03:53,"We're looking for a developer with good knowledge of CSS selectors. Your job will be to write the CSS selectors to program a web scraper to gather data from online retailers. You can verify the selector works by running document.querySelector(SELECTOR) or document.querySelectorAll(SELECTOR) in the dev tools console. 

1. pageNumberParameter - Paste the URL parameter that determines which page of results to show, e.g. from this link ""https://www.very.co.uk/sports-leisure/mens-sports-clothing/outdoor/e/b/119443,2781.end?pageNumber=2"" you would find ?pageNumber=2 and replace the page number with $i so it becomes ?pageNumber=$i
2. acceptCookiesSelector - This one is only required if the site has a cookies popup that blocks the page. Paste the CSS selector for a button that accepts the cookies.
3. pageCountSelector - CSS selector for the button or other HTML element where the innerText is ONLY the last page number. E.g. if there are 30 pages of jeans, find an element whose only text is ""30"" - this is typically located with several page buttons that might look like 1 2 3 4 5 ... 30
4. searchPageGrid - CSS selector on the search page for the container that holds all the links to product pages.
5. searchPageOrigin - CSS selector for the a tags with hrefs linking to product pages, duplicate hrefs don't matter but try to skip any ads. Instead of running document.querySelectorAll, this will be run like searchPageGrid.querySelectorAll so sometimes this can be simple as ""a""
6. searchPageTitle - CSS selector for the product title on the search page
7. searchPagePrice - CSS selector for the CURRENT product price on the search page
8. searchPageThumbnail - CSS selector for the product thumbnail on the search page, must have a src or a data-src or a data-srcset attribute with a link to the image. Make sure it works on all the products on the page because sometimes they're lazy-loaded.
9. productTitle - CSS selector for the product title on the product page
10. price - CSS selector for the product price on the product page
11. oldPrice - CSS selector for the original product price on the product page (if it doesn't exist, leave blank, but make sure to check at least one discounted product)
12. image - CSS selector for the first product image on the product page, must have a src or a data-src or a data-srcset attribute with a link to the image
We will be running the scraper and checking that each site is scraped correctly. You will be paid for each retailer you complete so make sure there are no errors. It should take about 10 minutes per retailer. If you're unsure how to write the selectors on a site/field, move onto the next one and fill in the text box(es) with the word TODO and we'll complete those ones. Start your proposal with ""CSS Selector"" so we know you've read it all. 

We're looking for someone who can scrape 75 of these sites this week. If you do a good job on this, there may be ongoing work for you as we add more retailers.

We will be able to provide a video example of how to scrape a site. Below is a list of each field that needs completing for each retailer.",,2020-03-06,Coventry,United Kingdom,GBP,CEO

CSS selectors to program a web scraper,Technology & Programming,Entry ($),Programming & Coding,GBP,200.0,remote,ALL,fixed_price,2023-01-23 21:03:53,"We're looking for a developer with good knowledge of CSS selectors. Your job will be to write the CSS selectors to program a web scraper to gather data from online retailers. You can verify the selector works by running document.querySelector(SELECTOR) or document.querySelectorAll(SELECTOR) in the dev tools console. 

1. pageNumberParameter - Paste the URL parameter that determines which page of results to show, e.g. from this link ""https://www.very.co.uk/sports-leisure/mens-sports-clothing/outdoor/e/b/119443,2781.end?pageNumber=2"" you would find ?pageNumber=2 and replace the page number with $i so it becomes ?pageNumber=$i
2. acceptCookiesSelector - This one is only required if the site has a cookies popup that blocks the page. Paste the CSS selector for a button that accepts the cookies.
3. pageCountSelector - CSS selector for the button or other HTML element where the innerText is ONLY the last page number. E.g. if there are 30 pages of jeans, find an element whose only text is ""30"" - this is typically located with several page buttons that might look like 1 2 3 4 5 ... 30
4. searchPageGrid - CSS selector on the search page for the container that holds all the links to product pages.
5. searchPageOrigin - CSS selector for the a tags with hrefs linking to product pages, duplicate hrefs don't matter but try to skip any ads. Instead of running document.querySelectorAll, this will be run like searchPageGrid.querySelectorAll so sometimes this can be simple as ""a""
6. searchPageTitle - CSS selector for the product title on the search page
7. searchPagePrice - CSS selector for the CURRENT product price on the search page
8. searchPageThumbnail - CSS selector for the product thumbnail on the search page, must have a src or a data-src or a data-srcset attribute with a link to the image. Make sure it works on all the products on the page because sometimes they're lazy-loaded.
9. productTitle - CSS selector for the product title on the product page
10. price - CSS selector for the product price on the product page
11. oldPrice - CSS selector for the original product price on the product page (if it doesn't exist, leave blank, but make sure to check at least one discounted product)
12. image - CSS selector for the first product image on the product page, must have a src or a data-src or a data-srcset attribute with a link to the image
We will be running the scraper and checking that each site is scraped correctly. You will be paid for each retailer you complete so make sure there are no errors. It should take about 10 minutes per retailer. If you're unsure how to write the selectors on a site/field, move onto the next one and fill in the text box(es) with the word TODO and we'll complete those ones. Start your proposal with ""CSS Selector"" so we know you've read it all. 

We're looking for someone who can scrape 75 of these sites this week. If you do a good job on this, there may be ongoing work for you as we add more retailers.

Just Like this Skull Bracelet But with Openable-Closable Jump Ring
One of the attachments shown below shows a skull bracelet that looks very much like the kind of 16cm long piece I would to have created - please note the T-bar at one end and jump ring at the other. The 16cm chain lengths will be employ to create chain-leather-chain handbag straps like the one shown in one of the attachments below. Without the need for cutting/welding, a handbag factory will attach the chains to leather straps by prying the jump rings open, threading the jump rings through eyelets on the leather straps and then closing the jump rings closed - that why the jump rings at the end of each 16cm long chain length has to be openable-closable. 

Material
Ideally, I would like these creation to look like shiny silver but be created from the kind of material usually employ to create handbag ‘hardware’. Oftentimes this is zinc alloy or brass, I think.


A Set of 4 Identical 16cm Long Unique Chain Pieces  (Times At Least 4)
For the first such unique chain that is sourced I would like four identical of such 16cm long pieces created. Then I would like to repeat that at least three more times - with three different unique chain designs. (So in total, I will end up with at least 16 pieces of the 16cm long creations.

Can You Source/Suggest Candidate Chain Design?
I would love one of the set of four 16cm chain length to created from a skull design just like the shown skull bracelet. Can you source such a chain? I would love if you could source similar chains that are made of identifiable items i .e chain made of interconnected , say, dogs, flowers, cats, other animals etc. And/or can you source chain designs that you think will help create beautiful handbags?

I need a programmer who is experienced in the development of video chatting app that will connect people randomly and/or based on interests. Both text chat and video chat.

I am an IT engineer so I know some stuff about app development, but I am not a developer and am not an expert. 

Initial version will be a proof of concept that will only randomly connect people with an option for registration. During this phase graphics, branding, colouring will be nailed down along with minimum functionality. Consider this phase a trial that, if the result is good enough, will result in a permanent arrangement.

Later the app will feature paid subscription functions, and should be able to securely hold client details. It should also allow automated card payments via Stripe or similar. It will also feature SMS activation for new user accounts and CAPTCHA to weed out bots.

Later revisions will begin to include social elements such as friending/messaging/following. Videos will also later be scanned for inappropriate/illegal content with users facing a resulting ban.

The UI should be vibrant, simple and streamlined to QUICKLY collect required details from the user, and then get them into the video chat as quickly as possible. It should be enjoyable to use, with effects such as moving graphical backgrounds, fades, and such.

The 'fun' element of the graphical user experience is of high importance. See: Every other social/chat/dating app ever made for examples. It should be slick, professional and not look or feel cheap/glitchy. 

I would like to see the following from interested parties:
- Examples of your past GUI/UX work, vibrantly branded and enjoyable/exciting to use. Examples of the animations and smooth transition between screens would also be desirable.
- What you would recommend to hold client details. Integrate with an existing CRM, or build something custom? Indicate why. Security is of paramount of importance.
- To work on Android/Apple/Web, whether you would use multiple native apps, or a hybrid app. The user experience must not simply be a responsive webpage cheaply wrapped in an app. It should feel native with little/no latency and smooth animations between screens. How would you achieve this? I have heard of Flutter as a potential modern solution to the native vs. hybrid problem. Would you use this, or a different method? Explain why.
- Examples of animated transitions between screens, seamless integration with branding and colouring across all screens.
- App logos. I want you to design the branding as well as develop the app. Show me your past work.

I have put £30 per hour as the rate, however the budget and spend will ultimately depend on the quality of the developer's past work.

I would like to NOT see the following from interested parties:
- A list of URLS to the Play Store or Apple store showing your work. Use attachments.
- Irrelevant examples. Book keeping apps, maps, project management... these are entirely irrelevant.
- 1000 words about you/your company. I do not care. Show me your work.
- Assuring me you are the best person. Everyone says this.
- A generic copy and paste.",,2017-06-04,Edinburgh,United Kingdom,GBP,Technical Consultant

Video Chat App,Technology & Programming,Expert ($$$),Mobile App Development,GBP,35.0,remote,ALL,hourly,2023-01-23 02:54:50,"Reposted with more strict requirements for applications. Last post received too many low quality submissions.

I need a programmer who is experienced in the development of video chatting app that will connect people randomly and/or based on interests. Both text chat and video chat.

I am an IT engineer so I know some stuff about app development, but I am not a developer and am not an expert. 

Initial version will be a proof of concept that will only randomly connect people with an option for registration. During this phase graphics, branding, colouring will be nailed down along with minimum functionality. Consider this phase a trial that, if the result is good enough, will result in a permanent arrangement.

Later the app will feature paid subscription functions, and should be able to securely hold client details. It should also allow automated card payments via Stripe or similar. It will also feature SMS activation for new user accounts and CAPTCHA to weed out bots.

Later revisions will begin to include social elements such as friending/messaging/following. Videos will also later be scanned for inappropriate/illegal content with users facing a resulting ban.

The UI should be vibrant, simple and streamlined to QUICKLY collect required details from the user, and then get them into the video chat as quickly as possible. It should be enjoyable to use, with effects such as moving graphical backgrounds, fades, and such.

The 'fun' element of the graphical user experience is of high importance. See: Every other social/chat/dating app ever made for examples. It should be slick, professional and not look or feel cheap/glitchy. 

I would like to see the following from interested parties:
- Examples of your past GUI/UX work, vibrantly branded and enjoyable/exciting to use. Examples of the animations and smooth transition between screens would also be desirable.
- What you would recommend to hold client details. Integrate with an existing CRM, or build something custom? Indicate why. Security is of paramount of importance.
- To work on Android/Apple/Web, whether you would use multiple native apps, or a hybrid app. The user experience must not simply be a responsive webpage cheaply wrapped in an app. It should feel native with little/no latency and smooth animations between screens. How would you achieve this? I have heard of Flutter as a potential modern solution to the native vs. hybrid problem. Would you use this, or a different method? Explain why.
- Examples of animated transitions between screens, seamless integration with branding and colouring across all screens.
- App logos. I want you to design the branding as well as develop the app. Show me your past work.

I have put £30 per hour as the rate, however the budget and spend will ultimately depend on the quality of the developer's past work.

I would like to NOT see the following from interested parties:
- A list of URLS to the Play Store or Apple store showing your work. Use attachments.
- Irrelevant examples. Book keeping apps, maps, project management... these are entirely irrelevant.
- 1000 words about you/your company. I do not care. Show me your work.
- Assuring me you are the best person. Everyone says this.
- A generic copy and paste.",,2017-06-04,Edinburgh,United Kingdom,GBP,Technical Consultant

- It needs to be muted (no audio) so that if customers scroll down to see products, they will not be irritated by the audio.

Please pay close attention to all of those requirements above, they are the minimum requirements.

repointing 4 joomla websites with a few tweaks to 2 of them,Design,Entry ($),Web Design,GBP,50.0,remote,ALL,fixed_price,2023-01-22 13:28:46,"hi all

I have 4 joomla sites which need to be housed on my godaddy package.  The previous host has sent me links with the files zipped together.

They've said it's a five minute job to replace each on GoDaddy and I could probably do it myself, but I'd rather trust a pro!

In addition to moving them I need to make a few minor tweaks - just removing the odd picture, hiding one page.

But I also wanted to check sign up boxes (to MailChimp) and the boxes for finance payments/and form applications to make sure they're working properly.

could you kindly quote me?

here are the sites:

www.wildfrontierproductions.com - straight move no changes
www.britishfilmmakersalliance.com - move, remove a couple of things and check sign up boxes are working
www.worldfilmshowcase.com - move and make sure the forms and payment pages are working

Just a brief outline of the situation: 

1. I had an existing Adsense account.

2. I opened a youtube channel for a friend and it automatically connected to that Adsense account (as I am new to 
youtube and Adsense I did not know how it worked properly).

3. I went through all of the steps and got the account verified. 

4. As the Adsense account was in my name so I had to put my own personal Tax information to the Adsense account. 

5. All was going well and we were views and getting paid, but the owner of the channel wanted to put the Adsense account in their name. 

6. Not knowing the consequences, I created an Adsense account under their name and tried to connect it to the 
Youtube Monetisation part. 

7. Youtube rejected the application stating: ""Thank you for your interest in AdSense. After reviewing your application, our specialists have found that it does not meet our programme criteria. Therefore, we are unable to accept you into our programme. Our AdSense programme policies are designed to ensure the effectiveness of Google ads for our publishers as well as for our advertisers.

- It needs to blend into the white background of the homepage, (so the edges of all video clips/photos need to blend into white). I do not want it to look like an embedded video, I want it to look like it is part of the website, so the edges HAVE TO BE WHITE.

- It needs to be muted (no audio) so that if customers scroll down to see products, they will not be irritated by the audio.

Please pay close attention to all of those requirements above, they are the minimum requirements.

a. Events can only happen within the given earliest and latest estimated dates and times seen in columns B and C.
b. Events can only happen between a minimum time and a maximum time defined for each day, see table Calendar in the sheet Time_constraints. (If a day isn't captured in this table, the minimum time should be 11 AM and the maximum time should be 22 PM).

Just a brief outline of the situation: 

1. I had an existing Adsense account.

2. I opened a youtube channel for a friend and it automatically connected to that Adsense account (as I am new to 
youtube and Adsense I did not know how it worked properly).

3. I went through all of the steps and got the account verified. 

4. As the Adsense account was in my name so I had to put my own personal Tax information to the Adsense account. 

5. All was going well and we were views and getting paid, but the owner of the channel wanted to put the Adsense account in their name. 

6. Not knowing the consequences, I created an Adsense account under their name and tried to connect it to the 
Youtube Monetisation part. 

7. Youtube rejected the application stating: ""Thank you for your interest in AdSense. After reviewing your application, our specialists have found that it does not meet our programme criteria. Therefore, we are unable to accept you into our programme. Our AdSense programme policies are designed to ensure the effectiveness of Google ads for our publishers as well as for our advertisers. We review all publishers and we reserve the right to decline any application. If you are able to make changes to meet our programme criteria, you may reapply for AdSense in the future. Please note that we may not be able to respond to enquiries regarding the specific reasons for our decision. Thank you for your understanding. Thanks, The Google AdSense Team""

It's not really an explanation of why it was rejected. 

8. The option to update, or fix anything on the channel has been restricted it is making us wait 32 days. (see attached image)

I need someone to come in and fix this and set up the new Adsense account on the youtube channel, we're getting lots of views and losing out on a lot of potential revenue.

We urgently need someone first thing Monday morning to get on the telephone to the six radio stations and discover:

a) who the students / volunteers for each project with each radio station are / were.
b) contact details for any of these - especially phone numbers
c) where they have got to with their project in each case (to make 7 minute radio dramas from a choice of scripts)?

The important things are a and b) . If we can make contact with the student / volunteer groups themselves on Monday we can probably take things forward from there. (Our mission is to get the plays finished by the end of the week and see if a representative from any of the groups would like to come to the whole project convention in Albanian next weekend!

a) Comfortable with French (University +/ native speaker) as persuading University societies to give up information is going to be needed.
  
b) Real persistence and doggedness as important as anything - this is NOT a situation for someone to say ""well its just a voice mail so I sent them an email"" - its going to be about finding clever ways to contact hte university, its student radio organisation and the collection of students involved.

A sheet is attached of the 6 relevant stations and the contact details we have. All of them were working with Elodie Hervier - the facilitator who has gone completely awol. Also we have the contact details for the central organisation Campus Radio as well.

We are proposing to pay £25 per successful contact with an actual student / volunteer from each group - so that is up to £150 which might take a morning or two mornings.

b) contact details for any of these - especially phone numbers
c) where they have got to with their project in each case (to make 7 minute radio dramas from a choice of scripts)?

a) who the students / volunteers for each project with each radio station are / were.
b) contact details for any of these - especially phone numbers
c) where they have got to with their project in each case (to make 7 minute radio dramas from a choice of scripts)?

a) Comfortable with French (University +/ native speaker) as persuading University societies to give up information is going to be needed.
  
b) Real persistence and doggedness as important as anything - this is NOT a situation for someone to say ""well its just a voice mail so I sent them an email"" - its going to be about finding clever ways to contact hte university, its student radio organisation and the collection of students involved.

A sheet is attached of the 6 relevant stations and the contact details we have. All of them were working with Elodie Hervier - the facilitator who has gone completely awol. Also we have the contact details for the central organisation Campus Radio as well.

Business Plan to establish a Finance  Company in Nigeria  ,Business,Expert ($$$),Consulting,GBP,75.0,remote,ALL,hourly,2023-01-20 13:31:00,"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) play a significant role in the development of the economy of many countries. According to the World Bank1, MSMEs represent about 90% of businesses worldwide. The growth of MSMEs in many countries, however, is often stifled by limited access to finance, as financial institutions are less likely to provide funding to MSMEs due to the high-risk nature of their businesses.

In Nigeria, the finance company licence was established by the Central Bank of Nigeria (""CBN"") to focus on meeting the financial needs of MSMEs. The CBN regulates finance companies through its Revised Guidelines for Finance Companies in Nigeria (the ""Guidelines"") issued in 2014.

A finance company is a company licensed by the CBN to provide financial services to individual consumers, and industrial, commercial or agricultural enterprises. These services include providing consumer loans, funds management, asset finance, project finance, local and international trade finance, debt factoring, debt securitization, debt administration, financial consultancy, loan syndication, warehouse receipt finance, covered bonds and issuing vouchers, coupons, cards and token stamps.

Hi,

Please refer this project--
 Grammarly API at https://developer.grammarly.com/

You have to use this API to feed in a folder containing PDF Files as input, and the Grammarly API will paraphrase the text and return a number of equivalent PDF files which will be saved to disk.

ALso refer this URL--> https://inside-machinelearning.com/en/use-yolov7/
YOu have to modify it so that it accepts a list of images in a folder and saves the output as an XML file. It gives list of objects in an image (OBject recognition).

Finally 3rd task is new-- go to an API, take output XML of previous step as input, and get as output (a) Images only (b) Illustrations only.

ANd 4th task-> PDF of step 1 has tags like img1.png and so on, simply insert output of 3rd step, which is img1.png of pdf(all images in a PDF one by one)-> 2nd step gives text based on the image--> 3rd step gives new images based on text ie objects in original image--> now insert all new images at placeholders for various images in PDF file.

THe main tasks are already coded as explained above. You have to combine these into a single Python project.


Do let me know if you can do this work.

Short company video needed!,"Video, Photo & Image",Expert ($$$),Videography,USD,200.0,remote,ALL,fixed_price,2023-01-20 02:47:04,"Looking for someone to create two short videos for an upcoming conference in our company. 

1. First one: short (20-30s) motivational video with a bunch of concepts of how “Together We Create” (our theme for 2023) is the first three words of many different statements.  Here are some of thoughts:  
 
Our Vision Statement is “Creating a world where mental health is in reach for all.”  
 
“Together We Create”  
 
Together – keeps the element of teamwork and alignment.

We – non-descript as to who this is which is intentional.  Is it the US and Israel? Sales and Marketing? BrainsWay and our customer partners (doctors) ? Individuals aligned on a share mission and vision? Yes.  All of the above. (And there is a capital “W”…)

Create – this is the first word of our vision.  It is a powerful word.  It means to make something that was not there before.  New opportunity? Aligned teams? Successful Customers? Efficiency? Momentum? Progress? Hope?  Once again, all of the above.  
 
I could see this as a short video of these words at the end of “Together We Create” to make complete sentences…something showing a cycle of these phrases to show the versatility.  Maybe using the photos of the teams all gathered or opening new clinics.  End with adding the “Together We” to the front of the vision statement.  
 
Our values of Teamwork, Optimism, Creativity all play into this. 
 
Photos and logos will be provided. (can use them with combination of stock images if needed)Please, send your quotes and timelines. Again, it should be a short but sweet 20-30s video. Thank you!

2. 10-15sec video/animated photos of all employees together showcased in a creative ways. Submit your ideas!

• DRAKENSBERG MOUNTAIN
The Drakensberg Mountain is the largest mountain on the Get a Bear Island. It is located on the Dragon Isles at the upper right side of the Get a Bear Island; by the right ear of the Bear. The mountain is inhabited by lots of mountain goats, who are the fastest animals on the Island; snakes can also be found on the mountain. The dragons sometimes eat the goats when they are unsuspecting but if there not fast the goats immediately run far away. A mysterious thing about the Drakensberg Mountain is that; the right side of the mountain is always dark. The sun never seems to be able to penetrate into that side, no matter how brightly it shines. The light always stops short of the farther right side of the mountain. Many have been too frightened to explore it and it has been told that those who did never returned.

• THE GULF OF DRAGONS ISLES
The Gulf of the Dragon Isles is located at the top right corner of the Get a Bear Island Map; beneath the Dragon Isles. The gulf is home to hundreds of fish. Sometimes, you can see a dragon diving in to the water to swoop up a fish or two that comes close to the surface. So, if you ever wish to sail through the gulf, make sure that you cover your raft with branches and move slowly so that they think that it is only a piece of wood floating by to avoid drawing the dragons’ attention. You also have to hang on tight to the boat because of the rough waters that can occur and rocks that could break the boat in a second. The water temperature is usually very low so it is mostly freezing cold; this is because of the current pulling water in from the Blizzard Plains.

• DRAGON ISLES
The Dragon Isles is located towards the upper right side of the Get a Bear Island; by the right ear of the Bear. The island is the origin of one of the creatures; whose statue is in the Land Of Honour. He is the Dragon Chief who rules the Draconic Clan. The weather in the Dragon Isles is mostly windy, whether it is night or day. The Dragon Isles has a very large mountain on it. The mountain is the largest structure on the Get a Bear Island. The mountain is called Drakensberg and it is the pride of the Dragon Isles. When men used to hunt dragons, it caused all the dragons to flee to the Drakensberg Mountain to hide; so, whenever rain falls, it rarely reaches the ground because of all the giant dragons there.",,2017-11-27,Glasgow,United Kingdom,GBP,
