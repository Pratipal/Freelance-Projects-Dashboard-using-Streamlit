Secondly, I had rented out a bag to a client last year, she didn't return it and had damaged the earrings. We reached out to her as she would have to replace/repair the goods in line with our terms and conditions, however she claimed that the bag was sent back. We then decided to file a dispute through the small claims court, she then asked us for a mediation call through the courts which we then agreed to. She didn't bother turning up to this, so we proceeded to submit our witness statement and bundle. We then had to pay over £350 for the hearing fee. The court hearing took place last week, I had written to the court to inform them that I wouldn't be in attendance, however it seems that they receive that and my absence was taken negatively and the claim was struck out. FYI she didn't attend either, I would like to revisit this as she is sitting on an expensive bag and I think we were treated incredibly unfairly by the court.

- Editing the About for the channel
- Creating and Editing a description template pre-made for all the videos.
- Editing the titles on ALL the videos (I usually charge for 10 titles, but for this project, I'll do them all since you don't have extremely many videos)
- Editing tags across all the videos that you have
- Generating tags that you can use in your future videos
- Editing playlists with description and tags.
- Fully optimizing your channel with SEO
- Give you tips on the new videos (on your niche category)
- Give you COMPLETELY FREE TOOL to generate tags and see which videos are searched in the niche of ""Pakistan"" and ""Travel"". It is widely used by lots of YouTubers that know it, so this one will definitely help you now and also in the future to generate real and organic traffic by your niche.

For additional rebrending such as Design and Video, I can offer to make you:
- A really nice YouTube channel banner
- Logo for your YouTube channel
- Create a template pre-made lower-third popups that you can use in your videos to promote your YouTube/Facebook and Instagram (if you have one, which is pretty important, if not no problem)

- Video Outro for your videos OR Video Outro for your reels (outros are different, either for a normal video or reel)

"""Unlock Your Imagination"" Looking for a children's illustrator",Design,Expert ($$$),Illustration & Drawing,GBP,24.0,remote,ALL,hourly,2023-01-26 08:44:53,"OBJECTIVE:
To create a set of playful and engaging illustrations for a new toddler and baby brand that will appeal to both children and parents.

Target Audience: Parents and caregivers of babies and toddlers (ages 0-3)

Key Message: Our brand is all about fostering creativity, imagination, and learning in young children through fun and interactive products.

There will be 2 visual styles and we can share a figma board that we started to provide some initial guidance.

**1st Visual Style**
Bright, colorful, and playful with a focus on children's themes like:

1. Pirates
2. Dinosaurs
3. Space / Planets
4. Unicorns
5. Stars
6. Zoo Animals
*not limited too

These should be easily recognizable to young children. The illustrations should be inspired by the natural world and should be engaging and interactive for children.

We are looking for a cross between:

Realistic: This style aims to depict people, animals, and objects as they appear in real life. It often uses detailed drawings and accurate colors. This style can be used for educational books for children.

Fantasy: This style is characterized by imaginative and fantastical elements such as magical creatures, enchanted landscapes, and otherworldly settings. It is often used in fairy tales, myths, and other stories that appeal to a child's sense of wonder and imagination.

**2nd Visual Style: 'Scandi Mum'**

Scandinavian mum style, often referred to as ""Scandi mum"" style, is a minimalistic and functional approach to parenting and motherhood. This style is characterized by a focus on simplicity, practicality, and comfort. It is often associated with the Nordic countries of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland, and is known for its clean lines, neutral colors, and natural materials.

Scandi mum style is often reflected in the way that mothers dress, with a focus on comfortable and functional clothing that is easy to move in. This can include items such as oversized sweaters, leggings, and practical shoes. The color palette is typically neutral, with a mix of gray, black, white, and beige tones.

The aesthetic is also reflected in the way that mothers decorate their homes, with a focus on minimalism and functionality. This often includes natural wood elements, light-colored walls, and simple, uncluttered spaces.

Scandinavian mum style is also associated with an emphasis on outdoor living and an active lifestyle. This is often reflected in the way that mothers dress their children, with a focus on practical, functional clothing that can easily be worn while playing outside.

In summary, Scandinavian mum style is a minimalist, practical and comfortable approach to parenting and motherhood, characterized by simple, natural materials, neutral colors and an active lifestyle

Tone: The illustrations should be upbeat and positive, with a focus on fun and learning. They should inspire a sense of wonder and curiosity in young children, and should encourage them to explore and discover the world around them.

Deliverables: A set of illustrations suitable for use across our range of products packaging, advertising materials, and in-store displays.

This can include illustrations of individual products, scenes featuring the products in use, and standalone illustrations that convey the brand's message and values.

Timeline: The illustrations should be completed within 4 weeks.",,2023-01-26,Riyadh,Saudi Arabia,USD,

Make 2D icons into 3D icons,Design,Expert ($$$),3D Design,GBP,25.0,remote_country,GB,hourly,2023-01-26 08:04:17,"We are having some icons produced for a website we are creating for one of our clients. See attached JPG for work in progress. We would like to print 3D versions for use in their retail space. I am guessing that the first stage in delivering that process is to create 3D designs. Please tell me if I am wrong. There are 30 icons in total. They will all be about 50cm x 50cm x 50cm in size (very rough dimensions for now) which I am telling you in case it is relevant. They could be bigger (1m cubed) or smaller (25cm cubed) but that is the best I can say for now. We may not do them all, we might do some of the easier ones, we might even redesign them if they don't work that well for 3D printing purposes. In fact, we might even use 3D versions on the website - in time, we might even animate them. We have already animated the 2D versions. So, the first stage in the process is to find the person we want to work with on this project from a 3D design perspective. If you have experience of turning 3D design work into physical outputs, perfect. If you can also help with animation, even better.

Right now I am looking at portfolios to select an artist - specific details will come when I have narrowed my search to 2 or 3 artists.

Work is to be done in Blender. At conclusion of each project after you have been paid, Blender application files will also be delivered to me.

Creative process: I will supply any 2D graphics as needed for references and foundational elements for creating modeling elements.

After the project is completed, I want to also arrange a series of instructional sessions to go through the process to show how the file is built from scratch (this is a separate billable item to be arranged at an agreed upon price in addition to the creative project fee - this may be done on a Zoom basis or whatever system the artist thinks would work best). For this, the artist will need to be a good and clear communicator with good organizational & people skills. 

There will most likely be a series of illustrations & animations needed. Although I am also working on getting up to speed with Blender, I may not always have time to do some of these projects myself so I am looking for someone that will be available for ongoing work.

Please send only a few specific examples of your work or a few specific links to view - I do not want to be overwhelmed with tons of content to wade through - a few good examples is all I need to get an idea of your suitability for this work (technical, simple machine rendering & animation - high quality, photo-realistic). As to level of complexity - think of a garage door that can be rendered from different angles and can be animated showing it going up and down; or, a locker opening and closing.

Pricing for this will have to wait until you have all details (sets of 2D drawings  showing front, side, top views will be supplied to give a full understanding for what is needed). Prior to project commencement, a NDA will be sent and details will follow after NDA is signed and returned to me. Additional clarification can also be via email communications, phone discussion and zoom sessions - there are also some photographic references and other visualization resources.

In short, I am seeking to get the contact details of UK based Cyber Security Recruiters who focus on placing contractors (not permanent full time positions, contracts should be the focus). The details required are set out in the template attached.

Recruiters want to get contacted so finding the required information should be easy (unlike finding sales leads for industry clients who don't want to get contacted). I accept sometimes the odd data point (i.e. landline phone number isn't available for the odd person). Important notes;

- Cyber security recruiters are those who specialise in the following terms; information security, cyber security, CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) and Head of Information Security or Head of Cyber Security.
- Please also look for ""headhunters"" > these specialise particularly in finding senior contractor positions and candidates.
- Please try to find two different people per company. Ideally I want a head of team, i.e. ""Desk Lead"", or ""Head of Cyber Security Recruitment"" and then a much more junior role, i.e. ""Researcher"" or ""Cyber Recruitment Consultant"".
- Looking for HIGH QUALITY DATA > please test emails for validity using an online tool. A sample of the output will be audited and any poor or inaccurate data will be identified and not paid for.
- I have no real number of names required, however many there are that are high quality. I expect around 100-200 perhaps.
- You'll likely find it easiest/fastest to start the research by researching the companies who specialise in cyber security / information security / IT security recruitment in the UK  and then find the right people (not the other way round).
- Price: please be competitive with your quotes. The £80 price is just a placeholder and expect the winner will be able to do it for less.

the pixel implementation affecting performance,Technology & Programming,Entry ($),Website Development,USD,180.0,remote,ALL,fixed_price,2023-01-25 05:59:36,"My Face book sales have dropped and the agency have asked to fix the following below. Does anyone understand and able to fix this isuue please?


There's an issue on the Purchase event, I've forwarded the info to you on another email. Please can you ask a web developer to check the pixel implementation, something is affecting the account's performance. here is the pixel implementation, something is affecting the account's performance. 

They were unable to fix the issue and have sent me this

Edward's had a look but can't see an error on the pixel! After more research, I've found a few users talking about this error. 
 
Who do you use for making changes to the website? They could be best suited for resolving the issue. 
 
To resolve this issue, you'll need to identify and fix the cause of the redundant Purchase events. Here are a few steps you can take:

1. Review your website's purchase flow: Make sure that the Purchase event is only firing on the final confirmation page of the checkout process and not on any other pages, such as the cart or product pages.
2. Check your Shopify settings: Go to your Shopify admin and make sure that the ""Enhanced Ecommerce"" setting is not enabled. This can cause the Purchase event to fire multiple times.
3. Check your pixel implementation: Make sure that the pixel is properly installed on your website and that it's only firing the Purchase event once per transaction. Use the Facebook Pixel Helper chrome extension to check for any errors.
4. Check for duplicate pixels: Make sure that you only have one pixel installed on your website. If you have multiple pixels, this can cause the Purchase event to fire multiple times.
5. Check for third-party apps: If you're using any third-party apps that add tracking pixels to your site, make sure that they are not firing the Purchase event multiple times.
6. Check for any scripts or codes that may fire the purchase event multiple times
 
There can be several reasons why your pixel is now firing redundant Purchase events, even though it was working correctly last month. Some possible causes include:
1. Changes to your website's purchase flow: If you've made changes to the pages or flow of your checkout process, it's possible that the Purchase event is now firing on multiple pages instead of just the final confirmation page.
2. Changes to your Shopify settings: If someone enabled the ""Enhanced Ecommerce"" setting in your Shopify admin, it could have caused the Purchase event to fire multiple times.
3. Issues with your pixel implementation: If there are any errors in the way the pixel is installed on your website, it could cause the Purchase event to fire multiple times.
4. Changes to your website's code: If you've made changes to your website's code, it's possible that you've introduced new scripts or codes that are firing the Purchase event multiple times.
5. Third-party apps: If you've recently added or removed any third-party apps that track pixels on your site, it could have caused the Purchase event to fire multiple times.
6. Caching Issues: Sometimes, if the cache of the website or browser is not cleared, the previous events might be still present and firing, even though they should have expired.

Example 2:

I'd like a script that waits until the prompt has been completed before it calls for the next one. For example, Question 1 would be called straight away.

I need a high quality finished result so please apply if you feel you have a strong understanding of figurative 3D skills and the ability to work well to this brief.

What we need:
A 3D sculpture, In the shape of double helix made out of people. They should be a mix of genders and ages. Almost like a a baroque painting, cherubs and nudes. 

An important factor is that the figures need to represent African descendants. So, some with dreadlocks etc

We do not need the faces too detailed so I would love it if you can make the general form quite angular and flat so we haven't got the issue of detail making the file too large - so, a flatter, chiseled finish please.

Please make the file available for blender and 3D printable too. The maquette/model will be about 40cm tall but we may need to enlarge it in the future so please give me access to different sized files too. 

We have 3 weeks before I need this job done and i will need updates as we go.

I will attach different images to show you the type of shape of a DNA Helix - please note, the groove element that will be explained in the file - this is how the curves go in an A, B, A pattern of one large one small - look it up if u need, there are many videos on youtube. Or ask and ill send you some.

I will also attach ideas of how the figures will hold each other too.

One image is AI generated and of the figures holding hands - I like everything about this apart from how they are holding each other- I need them to be hand to foot or hand to hand, maybe to convey the bit in the middle of the DNA strand you can have a person go across it too.
Also i do not want to see a seperate helix - just the one made from the people.

I have a more simple example of how this project was done at earlier stage with just hands that i will send to you after as its a large file.

This will be an ongoing project so plenty of scope to work together more if you can smash this one for me.

CSS selectors to program a web scraper,Technology & Programming,Entry ($),Programming & Coding,GBP,200.0,remote,ALL,fixed_price,2023-01-23 21:03:53,"We're looking for a developer with good knowledge of CSS selectors. Your job will be to write the CSS selectors to program a web scraper to gather data from online retailers. You can verify the selector works by running document.querySelector(SELECTOR) or document.querySelectorAll(SELECTOR) in the dev tools console. 

1. pageNumberParameter - Paste the URL parameter that determines which page of results to show, e.g. from this link ""https://www.very.co.uk/sports-leisure/mens-sports-clothing/outdoor/e/b/119443,2781.end?pageNumber=2"" you would find ?pageNumber=2 and replace the page number with $i so it becomes ?pageNumber=$i
2. acceptCookiesSelector - This one is only required if the site has a cookies popup that blocks the page. Paste the CSS selector for a button that accepts the cookies.
3. pageCountSelector - CSS selector for the button or other HTML element where the innerText is ONLY the last page number. E.g. if there are 30 pages of jeans, find an element whose only text is ""30"" - this is typically located with several page buttons that might look like 1 2 3 4 5 ... 30
4. searchPageGrid - CSS selector on the search page for the container that holds all the links to product pages.
5. searchPageOrigin - CSS selector for the a tags with hrefs linking to product pages, duplicate hrefs don't matter but try to skip any ads. Instead of running document.querySelectorAll, this will be run like searchPageGrid.querySelectorAll so sometimes this can be simple as ""a""
6. searchPageTitle - CSS selector for the product title on the search page
7. searchPagePrice - CSS selector for the CURRENT product price on the search page
8. searchPageThumbnail - CSS selector for the product thumbnail on the search page, must have a src or a data-src or a data-srcset attribute with a link to the image. Make sure it works on all the products on the page because sometimes they're lazy-loaded.
9. productTitle - CSS selector for the product title on the product page
10. price - CSS selector for the product price on the product page
11. oldPrice - CSS selector for the original product price on the product page (if it doesn't exist, leave blank, but make sure to check at least one discounted product)
12. image - CSS selector for the first product image on the product page, must have a src or a data-src or a data-srcset attribute with a link to the image
We will be running the scraper and checking that each site is scraped correctly. You will be paid for each retailer you complete so make sure there are no errors. It should take about 10 minutes per retailer. If you're unsure how to write the selectors on a site/field, move onto the next one and fill in the text box(es) with the word TODO and we'll complete those ones. Start your proposal with ""CSS Selector"" so we know you've read it all. 

We're looking for someone who can scrape 75 of these sites this week. If you do a good job on this, there may be ongoing work for you as we add more retailers.

To source,… 
T-bars 2. Chain (with unique design) and 3. Jump rings that have all already been designed and are available to buy to create a series of 16cm long pieces of chain that will have a T-bar at one end and a jump ring at the other end.

Just Like this Skull Bracelet But with Openable-Closable Jump Ring
One of the attachments shown below shows a skull bracelet that looks very much like the kind of 16cm long piece I would to have created - please note the T-bar at one end and jump ring at the other. The 16cm chain lengths will be employ to create chain-leather-chain handbag straps like the one shown in one of the attachments below. Without the need for cutting/welding, a handbag factory will attach the chains to leather straps by prying the jump rings open, threading the jump rings through eyelets on the leather straps and then closing the jump rings closed - that why the jump rings at the end of each 16cm long chain length has to be openable-closable. 

Material
Ideally, I would like these creation to look like shiny silver but be created from the kind of material usually employ to create handbag ‘hardware’. Oftentimes this is zinc alloy or brass, I think.


A Set of 4 Identical 16cm Long Unique Chain Pieces  (Times At Least 4)
For the first such unique chain that is sourced I would like four identical of such 16cm long pieces created. Then I would like to repeat that at least three more times - with three different unique chain designs. (So in total, I will end up with at least 16 pieces of the 16cm long creations.

Can You Source/Suggest Candidate Chain Design?
I would love one of the set of four 16cm chain length to created from a skull design just like the shown skull bracelet. Can you source such a chain? I would love if you could source similar chains that are made of identifiable items i .e chain made of interconnected , say, dogs, flowers, cats, other animals etc. And/or can you source chain designs that you think will help create beautiful handbags?

No buildings or other structures are to be erected in excess of 1m in height in front of these building lines, although the area may be surfaced and used for parking/circulation space or be landscaped.

They must have the ability to screen print key areas of the website, explain matters relating to the website using professional terms and liaise confidently with our Web developers pushing our thoughts, ideas and changes to them and keeping track of them.

Please message us for further information. We also have the links available for the front end/ back end of the website. We can also provide the document including modules of the sight to give a better understanding.

I need a programmer who is experienced in the development of video chatting app that will connect people randomly and/or based on interests. Both text chat and video chat.

I am an IT engineer so I know some stuff about app development, but I am not a developer and am not an expert. 

Initial version will be a proof of concept that will only randomly connect people with an option for registration. During this phase graphics, branding, colouring will be nailed down along with minimum functionality. Consider this phase a trial that, if the result is good enough, will result in a permanent arrangement.

Later the app will feature paid subscription functions, and should be able to securely hold client details. It should also allow automated card payments via Stripe or similar. It will also feature SMS activation for new user accounts and CAPTCHA to weed out bots.

Later revisions will begin to include social elements such as friending/messaging/following. Videos will also later be scanned for inappropriate/illegal content with users facing a resulting ban.

The UI should be vibrant, simple and streamlined to QUICKLY collect required details from the user, and then get them into the video chat as quickly as possible. It should be enjoyable to use, with effects such as moving graphical backgrounds, fades, and such.

The 'fun' element of the graphical user experience is of high importance. See: Every other social/chat/dating app ever made for examples. It should be slick, professional and not look or feel cheap/glitchy. 

I would like to see the following from interested parties:
- Examples of your past GUI/UX work, vibrantly branded and enjoyable/exciting to use. Examples of the animations and smooth transition between screens would also be desirable.
- What you would recommend to hold client details. Integrate with an existing CRM, or build something custom? Indicate why. Security is of paramount of importance.
- To work on Android/Apple/Web, whether you would use multiple native apps, or a hybrid app. The user experience must not simply be a responsive webpage cheaply wrapped in an app. It should feel native with little/no latency and smooth animations between screens. How would you achieve this? I have heard of Flutter as a potential modern solution to the native vs. hybrid problem. Would you use this, or a different method? Explain why.
- Examples of animated transitions between screens, seamless integration with branding and colouring across all screens.
- App logos. I want you to design the branding as well as develop the app. Show me your past work.

I have put £30 per hour as the rate, however the budget and spend will ultimately depend on the quality of the developer's past work.

I would like to NOT see the following from interested parties:
- A list of URLS to the Play Store or Apple store showing your work. Use attachments.
- Irrelevant examples. Book keeping apps, maps, project management... these are entirely irrelevant.
- 1000 words about you/your company. I do not care. Show me your work.
- Assuring me you are the best person. Everyone says this.

- It needs to blend into the white background of the homepage, (so the edges of all video clips/photos need to blend into white). I do not want it to look like an embedded video, I want it to look like it is part of the website, so the edges HAVE TO BE WHITE.

- It needs to have approximately 6 slides, that showcase the different video, photos and text.

- It needs to be muted (no audio) so that if customers scroll down to see products, they will not be irritated by the audio.

Please pay close attention to all of those requirements above, they are the minimum requirements.

I also have a formula in column D that uses iterative calculation to estimate the specific date and time for each event, so that the events are evenly distributed within the constraints given by columns B and C.
Please see the chart for an illustration of columns B, C, and D versus the events in column A.

1. I need a VBA or formula solution estimate best fit, while also accounting for the following:
2. The solution needs to take into consideration the following constraints:
a. Events can only happen within the given earliest and latest estimated dates and times seen in columns B and C.
b. Events can only happen between a minimum time and a maximum time defined for each day, see table Calendar in the sheet Time_constraints. (If a day isn't captured in this table, the minimum time should be 11 AM and the maximum time should be 22 PM).
c. Events can not happen at the exact same date + time as other events.

a) who the students / volunteers for each project with each radio station are / were.
b) contact details for any of these - especially phone numbers
c) where they have got to with their project in each case (to make 7 minute radio dramas from a choice of scripts)?

The important things are a and b) . If we can make contact with the student / volunteer groups themselves on Monday we can probably take things forward from there. (Our mission is to get the plays finished by the end of the week and see if a representative from any of the groups would like to come to the whole project convention in Albanian next weekend!

a) Comfortable with French (University +/ native speaker) as persuading University societies to give up information is going to be needed.
  
b) Real persistence and doggedness as important as anything - this is NOT a situation for someone to say ""well its just a voice mail so I sent them an email"" - its going to be about finding clever ways to contact hte university, its student radio organisation and the collection of students involved.

A sheet is attached of the 6 relevant stations and the contact details we have. All of them were working with Elodie Hervier - the facilitator who has gone completely awol. Also we have the contact details for the central organisation Campus Radio as well.

Business Plan to establish a Finance  Company in Nigeria  ,Business,Expert ($$$),Consulting,GBP,75.0,remote,ALL,hourly,2023-01-20 13:31:00,"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) play a significant role in the development of the economy of many countries. According to the World Bank1, MSMEs represent about 90% of businesses worldwide. The growth of MSMEs in many countries, however, is often stifled by limited access to finance, as financial institutions are less likely to provide funding to MSMEs due to the high-risk nature of their businesses.

In Nigeria, the finance company licence was established by the Central Bank of Nigeria (""CBN"") to focus on meeting the financial needs of MSMEs. The CBN regulates finance companies through its Revised Guidelines for Finance Companies in Nigeria (the ""Guidelines"") issued in 2014.

A finance company is a company licensed by the CBN to provide financial services to individual consumers, and industrial, commercial or agricultural enterprises.

Hi,

Please refer this project--
 Grammarly API at https://developer.grammarly.com/

You have to use this API to feed in a folder containing PDF Files as input, and the Grammarly API will paraphrase the text and return a number of equivalent PDF files which will be saved to disk.

ALso refer this URL--> https://inside-machinelearning.com/en/use-yolov7/
YOu have to modify it so that it accepts a list of images in a folder and saves the output as an XML file. It gives list of objects in an image (OBject recognition).

Finally 3rd task is new-- go to an API, take output XML of previous step as input, and get as output (a) Images only (b) Illustrations only.

ANd 4th task-> PDF of step 1 has tags like img1.png and so on, simply insert output of 3rd step, which is img1.png of pdf(all images in a PDF one by one)-> 2nd step gives text based on the image--> 3rd step gives new images based on text ie objects in original image--> now insert all new images at placeholders for various images in PDF file.

THe main tasks are already coded as explained above. You have to combine these into a single Python project.


Do let me know if you can do this work.

Short company video needed!,"Video, Photo & Image",Expert ($$$),Videography,USD,200.0,remote,ALL,fixed_price,2023-01-20 02:47:04,"Looking for someone to create two short videos for an upcoming conference in our company. 

1. First one: short (20-30s) motivational video with a bunch of concepts of how “Together We Create” (our theme for 2023) is the first three words of many different statements.  Here are some of thoughts:  
 
Our Vision Statement is “Creating a world where mental health is in reach for all.”  
 
“Together We Create”  
 
Together – keeps the element of teamwork and alignment.

We – non-descript as to who this is which is intentional.  Is it the US and Israel? Sales and Marketing? BrainsWay and our customer partners (doctors) ? Individuals aligned on a share mission and vision? Yes.  All of the above. (And there is a capital “W”…)

Create – this is the first word of our vision.  It is a powerful word.  It means to make something that was not there before.  New opportunity? Aligned teams? Successful Customers? Efficiency? Momentum? Progress? Hope?  Once again, all of the above.  
 
I could see this as a short video of these words at the end of “Together We Create” to make complete sentences…something showing a cycle of these phrases to show the versatility.  Maybe using the photos of the teams all gathered or opening new clinics.  End with adding the “Together We” to the front of the vision statement.  
 
Our values of Teamwork, Optimism, Creativity all play into this. 
 
Photos and logos will be provided. (can use them with combination of stock images if needed)Please, send your quotes and timelines. Again, it should be a short but sweet 20-30s video. Thank you!

2. 10-15sec video/animated photos of all employees together showcased in a creative ways. Submit your ideas!

• DRAKENSBERG MOUNTAIN
The Drakensberg Mountain is the largest mountain on the Get a Bear Island. It is located on the Dragon Isles at the upper right side of the Get a Bear Island; by the right ear of the Bear. The mountain is inhabited by lots of mountain goats, who are the fastest animals on the Island; snakes can also be found on the mountain. The dragons sometimes eat the goats when they are unsuspecting but if there not fast the goats immediately run far away. A mysterious thing about the Drakensberg Mountain is that; the right side of the mountain is always dark. The sun never seems to be able to penetrate into that side, no matter how brightly it shines. The light always stops short of the farther right side of the mountain. Many have been too frightened to explore it and it has been told that those who did never returned.

• THE GULF OF DRAGONS ISLES
The Gulf of the Dragon Isles is located at the top right corner of the Get a Bear Island Map; beneath the Dragon Isles. The gulf is home to hundreds of fish. Sometimes, you can see a dragon diving in to the water to swoop up a fish or two that comes close to the surface. So, if you ever wish to sail through the gulf, make sure that you cover your raft with branches and move slowly so that they think that it is only a piece of wood floating by to avoid drawing the dragons’ attention. You also have to hang on tight to the boat because of the rough waters that can occur and rocks that could break the boat in a second. The water temperature is usually very low so it is mostly freezing cold; this is because of the current pulling water in from the Blizzard Plains.

• DRAGON ISLES
The Dragon Isles is located towards the upper right side of the Get a Bear Island; by the right ear of the Bear. The island is the origin of one of the creatures; whose statue is in the Land Of Honour. He is the Dragon Chief who rules the Draconic Clan. The weather in the Dragon Isles is mostly windy, whether it is night or day. The Dragon Isles has a very large mountain on it. The mountain is the largest structure on the Get a Bear Island. The mountain is called Drakensberg and it is the pride of the Dragon Isles. When men used to hunt dragons, it caused all the dragons to flee to the Drakensberg Mountain to hide; so, whenever rain falls, it rarely reaches the ground because of all the giant dragons there.",,2017-11-27,Glasgow,United Kingdom,GBP,
